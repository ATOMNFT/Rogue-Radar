## Overview

**Rogue Radar** is a handheld ESP32-S3 firmware built for the **LilyGO T-Embed** that combines multiple wireless and utility tools into one rotary-driven interface.

The firmware uses **LVGL** for the UI, **TFT_eSPI** for the 320x170 ST7789 display, **BLE + WiFi** features from the ESP32 core, **TinyGPS++** for GPS data, **APA102 LEDs** for visual status feedback, and optional I2S speaker output for alerts and menu feedback.

It is designed around fast menu navigation, onboard scanning tools, live signal data, GPS stats, SD-based update support, and a clean embedded dashboard feel.

## Current Tool Set

### WiFi Tools
- **Network Scanner** – scans nearby access points and shows SSID, BSSID, RSSI, channel, and security type.
- **Deauth Detector** – monitors for deauthentication activity using promiscuous mode.
- **Channel Analyzer** – surveys channel activity and signal strength across WiFi channels.
- **PineAP Hunter** – watches for BSSIDs cycling through many SSIDs across scans.
- **Pwnagotchi Watch** – looks for Pwnagotchi beacon behavior and parses status data from beacon SSIDs.
- **Flock Detector** – flags WiFi activity associated with Flock-related SSID keywords, deduplicates hits by source MAC, and can show the source MAC in the results.

### BLE Tools
- **BLE Scanner** – scans nearby Bluetooth Low Energy devices and lists signal details.
- **AirTag Detector** – identifies AirTag-like BLE activity.
- **Flipper Detector** – looks for BLE patterns associated with Flipper-style devices.
- **Skimmer Detector** – checks for HC-03 / HC-05 / HC-06 type modules often used in skimmer-style builds.
- **Meta Detector** – looks for Meta / Ray-Ban smart-glasses related BLE advertisements.

### Misc Tools
- **Device Info** – shows firmware version, chip, flash, heap, CPU, and MAC details.
- **SD Update** – supports firmware update flow from SD card.
- **Brightness** – adjusts the TFT backlight with PWM brightness control.
- **Themes** – switches between the built-in UI color themes.
- **Scan Defaults** – adjusts BLE scan time, WiFi scan time, WiFi result limit, and deauth hop timing for the current session.
- **Dimming** – toggles inactivity-based screen and APA102 LED dimming.
- **LEDs** – toggles the APA102 ring on or off at runtime.
- **Rotation** – switches between normal and flipped landscape orientations.
- **Alert Sound** – toggles detection alert chirps.
- **Menu Sounds** – toggles encoder/menu feedback sounds separately from detection alerts.

### GPS Tools
- **GPS Stats** – displays live latitude, longitude, speed, altitude, and satellite data.
- **Wiggle Wars** – included as a GPS menu item for expansion / custom use.

## Arduino IDE Setup

### User_Setup Files
Make a backup of your files before replacing any. Drop the corresponding file/s (found above) for your device into `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\Arduino\libraries\TFT_eSPI-master`. And make sure you choose the correct file in the `User_Setup_Select.h` file.

| File Name |
|---|
| `User_Setup_CYD.h` |
| `User_Setup_CYD2USB.h` |
| `User_Setup_LilyGo_T_Embed_S3.h` |
| `User_Setup_nm_cyd_c5.h` |
| `User_Setup_Select.h` |

### Board settings
- **Board:** `ESP32S3 Dev Module`
- **Partition Scheme:** `Huge APP`

### Required libraries
- `TFT_eSPI`
- `lvgl` (the sketch notes target **9.0.0**)
- `RotaryEncoder` by mathertel
- `APA102` by Pololu
- `TinyGPSPlus`

### ESP32 core features used
- `WiFi`
- `esp_wifi`
- `BLEDevice`
- `BLEScan`
- `SD`
- `Update`
- `driver/i2s`

## LVGL Notes

Make sure your `lv_conf.h` has these enabled:

```cpp
#define LV_COLOR_DEPTH 16
#define LV_USE_LIST    1
#define LV_USE_LABEL   1
#define LV_USE_BTN     1
#define LV_USE_BAR     1
```

---

## TFT / Display Notes

The firmware is written for a **320x170** layout and uses **TFT_eSPI**.
You will need a correct `User_Setup.h` for your T-Embed display configuration.

The sketch also includes a splash screen system using:
- `splash.h`
- `SPLASH_TIME_MS`

## UI / Controls

Rogue Radar is built around a **rotary encoder driven interface** using LVGL input groups.

### Controls
- **Rotate encoder** to move through menus and lists
- **Press encoder** to select items
- **Hold encoder button for 5 seconds** to trigger power-off handling

The APA102 LEDs are also used for menu color feedback and scan animations. Optional speaker feedback can provide detection chirps and quiet menu tick/click sounds.
